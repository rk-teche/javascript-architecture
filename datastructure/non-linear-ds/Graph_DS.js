/**
 * ? Graph - 
 *  -- Non-linear data structure
 *  -- It is a collection of vertices (V) and edges (E)
 *   G = (V, E)
 * 
 * ? Types of Graphs -
 *  1. Connected Graph -- A graph where every edge connected with other edge
 *  2. Unconnected Graph -- some edges might not be connected
 * 
 *  ? Another type of Graphs -
 *  1. Directed Graph - follow the direction among the nodes
 *  2. Undirected Graph - no particular direction, only connected
 * 
 *  ! Note - Every tree can be counted as graph but every graph is not a tree
