/**
 * ? Tree 
 *   -- different Data Structure (DS) that is not sequential like stacks, queues, array
 *   -- It is an abstracted instructor that simulates a hierarchical tree structure like family tree
 *   -- Top most node -> Root Node
 *   -- Node which does not contain child -> Leaf Node
 *   -- Nodes have parent child relationship
 *   -- Each child node is essentially a sub-tree --> that means, it may contains its own child nodes
 *   -- Every node above a node is called --> ancestor nodes and
 *   -- Every node below the node is called --> descendant nodes
 *   -- Both Ancestors and descendant nodes are measure in depth (Call all the way from root or leaf node)
 *
 *  *Ex -> OOPs programming is pretty much creating trees with classes with single inheritance and all classes have pretty much nodes
 * 
 *  ? Type of Trees -
 *   1. Un-Ordered Tree - it means order of the node are not important
 *          --> Ex: 1.Dom Tree, 2. File System in your computer
 * 
 *   2. Ordered Tree -
 *          --> Ex: 1.Fibonacci series, 2. Binomial trees, 3. Binary trees
 *          
 * ? Binary Trees -
 *   -- Each node has 2 child nodes at max 
 *   -- where right node > (is greater than) > parent node
 *   -- and left node < (is less than) < parent node
 * 
 *  -- Binary tree are used in famous search algo binary tree search
 *  -- Another famous binary tree is the `binary heap` which is used in heap sort algorithm
 *  -- Binary heap tree is mostly balanced -- that means almost all nodes except the leaf node have both of their child nodes
 *  -- `AVL Tree` --> It is also a binary tree, invented by Andal Sonvelski and Landis
 *      --> It is pretty much a self balancing tree which means height of the left and right node differ most by one
